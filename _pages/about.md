Starting in Spring 2024, I will be joining the KAIST as a M.S. Student in ECL lab. In order to know how my PC works, my research interests lie in computer architecture, programmable network, and cloud computing system. Specially, now I am interested in CXL memory system, RDMA hardware offload, ML/DL framework, and how to make them efficient in cloud computing scenario.

I earned my B.Eng degree in Computer Science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT) At BUPT, I was advised by Prof. Jie Zhang. I once worked for Baidu as Network Virtulization Eengineer.
