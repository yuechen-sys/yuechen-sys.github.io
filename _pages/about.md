Starting in Spring 2024, I will be joining KAIST as an M.S. student in the ECL lab. My research interests include computer architecture, programmable networks, and cloud computing systems, driven by a desire to understand the inner workings of my PC. Specifically, I am currently focused on CXL memory systems, RDMA hardware offload, ML/DL frameworks, and optimizing these technologies for cloud computing environments.

I earned my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), where I was advised by Prof. Jie Zhang. I also gained industry experience working as a Network Virtualization Engineer at Baidu.

Additionally, I am an enthusiast of rhythm games such as SDVX, BMS, and OSU!
