Starting in Spring 2024, I will be joining the KAIST as an M.S. Student in the ECL lab. In order to know how my PC works, my research interests lie in computer architecture, programmable network, and cloud computing system. Specifically, now I am interested in CXL memory system, RDMA hardware offload, ML/DL framework, and how to make them efficient in cloud computing scenarios.

I earned my B.Eng degree in Computer Science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT). At BUPT, I was advised by Prof. Jie Zhang. I once worked for Baidu as a Network Virtualization Engineer.
