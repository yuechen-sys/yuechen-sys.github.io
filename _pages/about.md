Starting in Spring 2024, I will be joining the KAIST as a M.S. Student in ECL lab. My research interests lie in computer system architecture, machine learning, and cloud.

I earned my B.Eng degree in Computer Science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT) At BUPT, I was advised by Prof. Jie Zhang. I once worked for Baidu as Network Virtulization Eengineers.
